# HK-modswitcher
A simple set of batch files for the Steam version of Hollow Knight (1.4.3.2) to toggle the ModdingAPI. 

Last updated: Aug 25, 2021
ModdingAPI version: 1.4.3.2-60
Minisavestates version: 1.0.0

 - Extract to Hollow Knight install folder (folder containing hollow_knight.exe).
 - Run modded.bat to switch game to modded.
 - Run vanilla.bat to switch game to vanilla.
 - Run savestates.bat to switch game to vanilla + minisavestates mod.

If you wish to update the modding API version and a new version of this archive is not available, then you can copy the file <install location>\hollow_knight_data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll and use it to replace Assembly-CSharp-Modded.dll

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This version of the will launch the game through the Steam launcher using its unique appid; this means that anything from the Steam interface will work, including the FPS counter and Steam overlay. This will not work with the GOG version, or the game itself added as a non-Steam game.
